# LGMVIP-Java-Task-03
This project contains an internship project for scientific calculator  which was developed with java.

Description :

This program called Scientific Calculator is programmed in Java, it provides advanced mathematical functions beyond basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. These advanced functions include trigonometric functions, logarithmic functions and exponential functions.

The program has been tailored to handle both simple and complex mathematical expressions. It parses the input expression and evaluate it using the appropriate mathematical functions. Exception handling was implemmented to aid smooth flow of the program to prevent runtime errors and to guide users on how to use the program.

In addition to the basic arithmetic operations, the calculator provide number buttons and functions for advanced mathematical operations like square root, logarithm, exponentiation, trigonometric functions, and others. These functions can be implemented using the Java Math library, which provides a wide range of mathematical functions.

The user interface allows users to perform operations like clearing the display, backspace, and memory functions like recalling previously the last inputted values.

Overall, a scientific calculator in Java involves creating a user interface, parsing and evaluating mathematical expressions, implementing advanced mathematical functions, and handling user input. It requires knowledge of Java programming, java swings, event listeners and advanced mathematical concepts.
